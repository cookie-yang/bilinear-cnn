# Bilinear_CNN TensorFlow

## This is an implementation of Bilinear Convolutional Neural Network (Bilinear_CNN) using TensorFlow.

Main objective of this project is to implement Bilinear
Convolutional Neural Network (Bilinear_CNN) for Fine-grained Visual Recognition using
TensorFlow. I implemented the Bilinear
Convolutional Neural Network (Bilinear_CNN) model as
described in the http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/docs/bcnn_iccv15.pdf
 and trained it on the FGVC-Aircraft
dataset with 100 categories. Bilinear
Convolutional Neural Network model combines
two Convolutional Neural Network architectures pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset
using outer product at each location in the image. Training
Bilinear Convolutional Neural Network  model is a two step training procedure in which
the last fully connected layer is trained first followed by
the fine-tuning entire model using back propagation. In
this project, I present experimental results of two methods
on top of the Bilinear_CNN (DD) model as described in http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/bcnn/docs/bcnn_iccv15.pdf
which uses two VGG16 models pretrained on ImageNet
dataset and then Bilinear_CNN (DD) model is trained on the FGVCAircraft
dataset. One, I experimented with a slightly different
approach in the two-step training procedure, where
the training of the last layer is interrupted after 10-15
epochs and fine-tuning the entire model was started after
that. Two, I used random cropping of images during the
training of Bilinear_CNN (DD) model to see if there is any significant
improvement in the accuracy of the Bilinear_CNN (DD) model
on the FGVC-Aircraft dataset. I obtain 86.4% accuracy
with the first method and 85.41% accuracy with the second
method. Training of the network is done on NVIDIA Tesla
M40 GPU. Training of last layer of Bilinear_CNN (DD) TensorFlow model runs
at 20 frames/second and fine-tuning the entire Bilinear_CNN (DD) TensorFlow model runs
at 10 frames/second.

I provide the Bilinear_CNN (BCNN) implmentation in TensorFlow. 

bcnn_DD_woft.py and bcnn_DD_woft_with_random_crops.py are TensorFlow files used 
for the first step of the training procedure where only last layer of the Bilinear_CNN (DD) model is trained.</br>
--> Learning rate = 0.9</br>
--> Optimizer = Momentum optimizer with 0.9 momentum</br>

bcnn_finetuning.py and bcnn_finetuning_with_random_crops.py are TensorFlow files used 
for the second step of the training procedure where finetuning is performed on the
entire Bilinear_CNN (DD) model.</br>
--> Learning rate = 0.001</br>
--> Optimizer = Momentum optimizer with 0.9 momentum</br>
